                If you've come this far, I assume you've spent more than 30 seconds on my website. And for that â€”thank

                I am an electrical engineer who has worked <HoverGIF text="6 years" /> in the consulting engineering
                industry where I have done services such as upgrading power distribution systems and designing
                architectural lighting. There are only so many ways you can change a lightbulb{" "}
                <em>(quite literally)...</em> So in recent years, I wanted to explore new avenues that would allow me to
                display my problem-solving skills and creativity. This has lead me to web-development as I liked the
                logical approach associated with programming and the rapid expansion of innovation behind web-design.

          <h2>My Values and Design Approach</h2>
          <div className="values-cont">
            <div className="value">
              <h3>Form Follows Function</h3>
              <span>
                I believe what makes a good design is when the design reflects its practicality over aesthetics;
                emphasizing function, simplicity, and efficiency. This is a more utilitarian stylistic approach.
              </span>
            </div>
            <div className="value">
              <h3>Re-usable & Scalable Code</h3>
              <span>
                I create code with the assumption that I will always re-use and expand upon it in later projects. This
                mindset ensures my code will be modular, extensible, and clean.
              </span>
            </div>
            <div className="value">
              <h3>Logical Problem-Solving</h3>
              <span>
                When faced with challenging problems, I tend to break down complex problems into smaller, more
                manageable ones. By using reasoning, evidence, and logical thinking, I can arrive at an effective
                solution.

                I spend most of my day at the computer whether it's work, watching videos, or gaming. I run a dual-boot
                PC of Windows 10 for general use and Ubuntu for web-development. Besides sitting at my desk, I also have
                other interests as well.

                Contrary to the outdoor image you see, I'm actually terrified of heights. I primarily do bouldering and
                sometimes belay in an indoor gym. I am by no means a <em>pro</em>, but I consider myself pretty average
                where I hover around the <em>"V4-V6"</em> grade range.

                I enjoy woodworking, 3D printing, and all things DIY. I love creating projects that either serve a
                purpose to me or further support my hobbies. For woodworking or 3D printing, I like to model everything
                in Sketchup to plan out my designs.
