        <p>
          If you've come this far, I assume you've spent at least more than 30
          seconds on my website. And for that â€”thank you! This page is more
          personal than the others and is just a place to get to know me better.

        <p>
          I spend most of my day at my desk whether it's work, watching videos,
          or gaming. However, I also have other interests as well.

          Contrary to the outdoor image you see, I actually am terrified of
          heights. I primarily do bouldering or belay in an indoor gym where I
          typically hover around the <em>"V4-V6"</em> grade range.

        <p>
          I enjoy woodworking, 3D printing, and all things DIY . I love creating
          projects that either serve a purpose to me or support my hobbies. For
          either woodworking or 3D printing, I like to design everything in
          Sketchup.
