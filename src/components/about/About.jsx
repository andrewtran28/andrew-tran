      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        If you've come this far, I assume you've spent at least more than 30
        seconds on my website. And for that —thank you! This page is more
        personal than the others and is just a place to get to know me better.

        I spend most of my day at the computer whether it's work, watching
        videos, or gaming. That being said, I tend to keep my space{" "}
        <strong>organized and minimal</strong>. This is how I like everything to
        be in general. The following selection is a selection of my setup for
        web development.

        When I am not around my computer, I enjoy all things DIY and creating
        projects that either serve a purpose to me or support my hobbies. It's
        one of the reasons why I wanted to go into web-development because I
        wanted to show my friends and family another way of going, "Hey —check
        this out!".
