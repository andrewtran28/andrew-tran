              I am an electrical engineer who has worked{" "}
              <HoverGIF text="6 years" /> in the consulting engineering industry
              where I have done services such as upgrading power distribution
              systems and designing architectural lighting. In recent years, I
              wanted to explore new avenues that would allow me to display my
              problem-solving skills and creativity. There are only so many ways
              you can change a lightbulb <em>(quite literally)...</em> This has
              lead me to web-development as I liked the logical approach
              associated with programming and the rapid expansion of innovation
              behind web-design.

        <h2>My Values and Design Approach</h2>
        <div className="values-cont">
          <div className="value">
            <h3>Form Follows Function</h3>
            <span>
              I believe what makes a good design is when the design reflects
              it's practicality over aesthetics; emphasizing function,
              simplicity, and efficiency. This is a more utilitarian stylistic
              approach.

          <div className="value">
            <h3>Re-usable & Scalable Code</h3>
            <span>
              I create code with the assumption that I will always re-use and
              expand upon it in later projects. This mindset ensures my code
              will be modular, extensible, and clean.

          <div className="value">
            <h3>Logical Problem-Solving</h3>
            <span>
              When faced with challenging problems, I tend to break down complex
              problems into smaller, more manageable ones. By using reasoning,
              evidence, and logical thinking, I can arrive at an effective
              solution.

            <p>
              I spend most of my day at the computer whether it's work, watching
              videos, or gaming. I run a dual-boot PC of Windows 10 for general
              use and Ubuntu for web-development. Besides sitting at my desk, I
              also have other interests as well.

              <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The colour and theme of my website was

              Contrary to the outdoor image you see, I'm actually terrified of
              heights. I primarily do bouldering and sometimes belay in an
              indoor gym. If you were curios, I'm by no means a <em>pro</em>,
              but I consider myself pretty average where I hover around the{" "}
              <em>"V4-V6"</em> grade range.

              I enjoy woodworking, 3D printing, and all things DIY. I love
              creating projects that either serve a purpose to me or further
              support my hobbies. For woodworking or 3D printing, I like to
              model everything in Sketchup to plan out my designs. Check out
              some of the things I've made during my free time!
